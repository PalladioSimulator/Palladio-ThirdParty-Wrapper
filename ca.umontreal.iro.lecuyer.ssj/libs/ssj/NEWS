What is new in version SSJ-1.2.1
--------------------------------

- package probdist
   * BetaDist: bug correction in the getMaximumLikelihoodEstimate. Did not
     work for a range of parameters alpha, beta.

   * *Dist: improvements and corrections in getMaximumLikelihoodEstimate.

   * When u = 1, the inverseF method now returns Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
     instead of throwing an exception, for distributions with infinite range.

   * Improvements of some distributions far in the tails.

What is new in version SSJ-1.2
--------------------------------


- new package probdistmulti
     For multivariate probability distributions.

- new package randvarmulti
     For multivariate non-uniform random number generators. 

- package probdist
   * Removed the two-dimensionnal distributions BiNormalDist, BiNormalGenzDist,
     ContinuousDistribution2Dim, BiNormalDonnellyDist, BivariateTDist and
     moved them to package probdistmulti. The BivariateTDist distribution has 
     been renamed BiStudentDist.

   * New methods getMean, getVariance and getStandardDeviation to get the mean,
     the variance and the standard deviation for probability distributions.

   * New methods getMaximumLikelihoodEstimate and getInstanceFromMLE that imple-
     ment the maximum likelihood estimator for most probability distributions.

   * New probability distributions: UniformIntDist, FatigueLifeDist, PascalDist,
     FisherFDist, HyperbolicSecantDist, InverseGaussianDist, LoglogisticDist,
     Pearson5Dist, Pearson6Dist.

   * The distribution NegativeBinomialDist now takes a double instead of an int
     as its first parameter; the distribution with an integer as first 
     parameter is now called PascalDist (it is the former NegativeBinomialDist).

   * New methods in DistributionFactory.

- package randvar
   * New non-uniform random number generators: UniformIntGen, FatigueLifeGen,
     FisherFGen, HyperbolicSecantGen, InverseGaussianGen, LoglogisticGen,
     Pearson5Gen, Pearson6Gen.

   * New class RandomVariateGenWithCache: caches random values for more
     efficiency when using common random numbers.

   * The generator NegativeBinomialConvolutionGen has been renamed
     PascalConvolutionGen.

- package rng
   * New classes RandomStreamWithCache, which caches random values for more
     efficiency, and TruncatedRandomStream, which generates uniform random
     numbers in a subinterval of [0, 1].

- package util
   * New classes TextDataReader (reads data from text files), JDBCManager (
     interface for accessing a database), MathFunction (to pass an arbitrary
     function as argument to another) and Misc (miscellaneous functions).

   * New RootFinder class to solve one-dimensional non-linear equations.

   * New methods Num.digamma, Num.trigamma, Num.tetragamma: the logarithmic
     derivatives of the Gamma function. Added Num.evalChebyStar for the
     evaluation of shifted Chebychev polynomials.

   * New methods PrintfFormat.formatWithError to print real intervals.


==========================================================================
What is new in version SSJ-1.1.9
--------------------------------

- package util
  Added Num.log1p(x) for better accuracy of log(1 + x) at small x.

- package randvar
  Added the classes BetaSymmetricalPolarGen and BetaSymmetricalBestGen
    that generate symmetrical Beta variates.

- package rng
  Provided a faster method to jump the the next substreams in all the WELL*
  generators and in the F2NL607 generator.

- package probdist
  * Replaced all functions Math.log(1+x) by Num.log1p(x) for better accuracy.

  * Corrected LogarithmicDist:
       the probabilities were not always computed correctly.

  * Corrected a bug in BinomialDist:
       the method inverseF(u) had a bug for n = 1.

  * Added the bivariate normal distribution:
       classes BiNormalDist, BiNormalDonnellyDist and BiNormalGenzDist

  * Added the bivariate t distribution:
       class BivariateTDist.

  * Added the Brent-Dekker method to compute the inverse distribution function
    for an arbitrary continuous probability function.

- package hups
  * Changed the constructors in class NiedXingSequenceBase2. The old 3
    arguments constructor has been eliminated and the 4 arguments constructor
    of the previous version has become the 3 arguments constructor
    of the new version. This gives the correct generating matrices for the
    Niederreiter-Xing sequence; the old 3 arguments constructor used
    the transposed generating matrices.

  * Correction in NiedXingSequenceBase2 and in NiedSequenceBase2 and in
    DigitalNetBase2FromFile: did not work correctly for number of bits = w < 31.


==========================================================================
What is new in version SSJ-1.1.8
--------------------------------

- package rng
   LFSR113, LFSR258:
    programmed a faster method nextInt

- package gof
   FBar, FDist:
    added a better approximation for the Anderson-Darling distribution.

- package probdist
   BetaSymmetricalDist:
    added a much faster inverse distribution for parameter alpha > 1.

   BetaDist:
    corrected a bug that gave the wrong values for the CDF for some 
    range of parameters.

   BinomialDist, PoissonDist, 
    ExponentialDist, JohnsonSUDist, ParetoDist, WeibullDist:
    added a better approximation in the tails of the distributions.

   GammaDist: added a better approximation for large alpha.

   Corrected a bug in DiscreteDistribution: the inverseF function was
   not correct for cdf(x) > 0.5.

   Made a correction in EmpiricalDist: the barF function.

- package randvar
   BetaStratifiedRejectionGen  object always returned 0.
    Bug correction

   GammaRejectionLoglogisticGen object went into infinite loop.
    Bug correction

- package util
   class ChronoSingleThread has been added.

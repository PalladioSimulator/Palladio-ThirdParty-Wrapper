For the PCM, Opt4J has been taken unchanged except for 
- Adding Criteria and Constraints (Qais DA)
- commenting out dependencies to Ptolemy Plot.
- removing benchmark and sat from the build path
- commenting out references to sat in other code. 

Thus, the viewer and visualization functionality will not work in the PCM environment.
